1. Performance Metrics Analysis

Calculate click-through rates (CTR) and conversion rates for different ad campaigns
SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks,
    SUM(total_conversion) AS total_conversions,
    SUM(approved_conversion) AS approved_conversions,
    SUM(clicks) / SUM(impressions) AS click_through_rate,
    SUM(approved_conversion) / SUM(clicks) AS conversion_rate
FROM fb_ads_data
GROUP BY campaign_id
ORDER BY campaign_id;

2. Campaign Segmentation Analysis

Group ads based on age, gender, and interest categories and analyze performance metrics
SELECT 
    age,
    gender,
    interest1,
    interest2,
    interest3,
    SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions,
    SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks,
    SUM(total_conversion) AS total_conversions,
    SUM(approved_conversion) AS approved_conversions
FROM fb_ads_data
GROUP BY age, gender, interest1, interest2, interest3
ORDER BY total_impressions DESC;

3. Time Series Analysis:
Track the performance of campaigns over time and identify trends

SELECT 
    reporting_start,
    SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions,
    SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks,
    SUM(total_conversion) AS total_conversions,
    SUM(approved_conversion) AS approved_conversions
FROM fb_ads_data
GROUP BY reporting_start
ORDER BY reporting_start;

4. Cost Analysis:
Analyze the amount spent on different campaigns and compare with performance metrics

SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    SUM(spent) AS total_spent,
    SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions,
    SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks,
    SUM(total_conversion) AS total_conversions,
    SUM(approved_conversion) AS approved_conversions,
    SUM(spent) / SUM(total_conversion) AS cost_per_conversion
FROM fb_ads_data
GROUP BY campaign_id
ORDER BY campaign_id;

5.Engagement Analysis:
Analyze user engagement metrics

SELECT 
    campaign_id,
    AVG(time_spent_on_ad) AS average_time_spent,
    COUNT(user_id) AS total_engaged_users
FROM fb_ads_data
WHERE time_spent_on_ad > 0
GROUP BY campaign_id
ORDER BY average_time_spent DESC;
